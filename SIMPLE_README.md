# Wish Bubble App - Simple Version

This is a simplified version of the Wish Bubble app with the new social feature prototype. This version works without Firebase integration, using mock data instead.

## Features

1. **Main Wish Bubble Feature**
   - Create wishes that float up as bubbles
   - Add images to your wishes
   - Customize animation styles

2. **Social Feature Prototype**
   - View wishes shared by others (mock data)
   - Send energy to wishes with beautiful animations
   - Sign in/up with mock authentication
   - Share your own wishes

## How to Run

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Build and run the app on a simulator or device
3. Navigate to the "Community" tab to see the social feature

## Using the Social Feature

1. **View Wishes**: Browse through wishes shared by others
2. **Send Energy**: Tap the "Send Energy" button on any wish to see the energy flow animation
3. **Sign In**: Tap "Sign In" to use a mock account (any email/password will work)
4. **Share Wishes**: After signing in, tap "Share a Wish" to create your own wish

## Notes

- This is a prototype version without actual backend connectivity
- All data is stored locally and will be reset when the app restarts
- The energy animation is fully functional and demonstrates the core visual concept

## Next Steps

When you're ready to implement the full version with Firebase:
1. Follow the setup instructions in the main README.md
2. Add the Firebase SDK dependencies
3. Uncomment the Firebase configuration in the app
